\section{Introduction}

\section{Related Work}

There is a rich litterature related to Motion Planning and a very
detailed survey of traditional methods is provided in \cite{7490340}.
Among the first 4 successful participants of DARPA Urban Challenge
in 2007, the approaches vary. The winner, CMU Boss vehicle used variational
techniques for local trajectory generation in a structured environment.
This was done in a 2 steps path-velocity decomposition. A first step
of path planning, using variational techniques, is performed and for
every candidate path, a combination of different velocity profiles
(constant, linear, linear ramp, trapezoidal) is applied : the combination
of a path and velocity profile defines a trajectory. In unstructured
environments (parking lots) or in error recovery situations a lattice
graph in 4-dimensional configuration space (position, orientation
and velocity) is searched with Anytime D{*} algorithm to find a collision-free
path. More details are provided in \cite{Ferguson2009MotionPI,article,5980223}.
The vehicle from Stanford used a search strategy coined Hybrid A{*}
that constructs a tree of motion primitives by recursively applying
a finite set of maneuvers. The search was guided by a carefully designed
heuristic. The vehicle arriving 3rd, Victor Tango from Virginia Tech,
constructs a graph discretization of possible maneuvers and searches
the graph with the A{*} algorithm. The vehicle arriving 4th, developed
by MIT used a variant of RRT algorithm with biased sampling. While
all these techniques differ, they fundamentally rely on a graph search
where nodes correspond to a configuration state and edges correspond
to elementary motion primitives. Although they provide solutions,
the runtime and state space can grow exponentially large. In this
context, the use of heuristic to guide the search is important.

More recently, Reinforcement Learning and Deep RL have been investigated
in the context of Autonomous Driving for Decision Making either at
the Behavioural Planning or Motion Planning level. In some research
papers from Volvo \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1803-10056} and BMW
\cite{inproceedings} , an RL agent is trained in simulation to take
decision at a higher tactical level: the decisions relate to a maneuver
selection, like lane change, rather than a low level acceleration
command. DQN is used to train an agent. But the problem with Reinforcement
Learning is that the utility is optimized in expectation. So even
if the reward is designed to avoid collisions, this will be optimized
in expectation: ultimately it is as if safety would be enforced with
soft constraints rather than hard constraints. Which is of course
not acceptable for a real vehicle. To solve this problem in \cite{inproceedings}
an additional safety check layer is added after the DQN agent to eventually
override the DQN agent decision if it is considered unsafe. Checking
a decision wrt to a specific criteria is simpler than designing a
decision making system that jointly optimizes efficiency, comfort
and safety objectives. With RL applied to AD we have to account for
additional safety checks. In \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1904-07189}
Deep RL is applied at the local planner level: the action space is
a set of longitudinal accelerations $\left\{ -4m/s^{2},-2m/s^{2},0m/s^{2},2m/s^{2}\right\} $
applied along a given path at a T-intersection. Safety is handled
in a different way here compared to previous BMW approach: the agent
is constrained to choose among a restricted set of safe actions per
state. So the safety is enforce before Deep RL. Ultimately car manufacters
may want to combine both types of safety checks: constraining the
action set per state before enabling an RL agent to make its own decision,
and checking again the final sequence of decisions proposed by the
RL agent.

Now the interesting topic is how to best combine traditional Motion
Planning with RL. What are the limitations of these techniques in
isolation and how to use the strengths of both approaches and circumvent
their weaknesses. Traditional motion planning relies heavily on tree
search and to enable real time solutions good heuristics are required.
Designing a good heuristic is hard. What if we could learn it ? By
training an agent with model free RL we can potentially end up with
an agent that performs pretty well most of the time and from time
to times fails miserably in a way that is hard to explain. The main
problems with model free RL are sample efficiency (we need a lot of
data), enforcing hard constraints and explainability (how can we explain
the decision taken by a RL agent which may become a problem for a
car manufacturer). While a model based planning method has the advantages
of explainability, do not rely on data and can deal in a more systematic
way with hard constraints. As demonstrated in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1904-11483}
in simple situations RL methods have no benefit over rule based methods,
pure RL does not enable the agent to act in safer way. But when the
situation becomes much more complex with an increasing number of cars
and pedestrians, the benefits of Deep RL methods become clear.

In the gaming domain, chess and go, performances superior to human
performances have been achieved with AlphaGo Zero \cite{Silver2017MasteringTG}:
by combining planning with MCTS tree search and learning with RL.
A neural network biases the sampling towards the most relevant parts
of the search tree: a learnt policy-value function is used as a heuristic
during inference. While during training, MCTS is used to improve the
sample efficiency of RL training. Now there are a few major differences
between a game like chess or go and our initial Motion Planning problem.
In chess or go the state space is discrete and fully observable while
in AD the state space is continuous and partially observable. In terms
of action sets in both cases, we can deal with discrete action sets.
But another challenge is that self-play can not be used in the context
of Motion Planning. These challenges have been recently tackled in
different publications. The applicability of AlphaGo Zero to Autonomous
Driving has been studied in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1905-02680,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1905-12197,8814125}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Baseline: the decision is fast, immediate, but we find a collision
free velocity profile only in $35\%$ of the cases.
\item Oracle: the search space is big. With a time step of $250$ ms, looking
for a collision free velocity profile over the next $100$ meters
we find in $100\%$ of the cases a collision free solution; but in
$47.2$ seconds with UCS and in $190.7$ seconds with DP running on
an iCore9. We explored the graph with a depth of 24. UCS has a complexity
of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ with $n=\left|\text{states}\right|$. It
potentially explores fewer states than DP.
